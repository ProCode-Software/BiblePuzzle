# How to play
BiblePuzzle is a game just like Typing.com, but with Bible verses. It is easy to get started with. Just go to <https://procode-software.github.io/BiblePuzzle>

## Name
Adding you name is optional, but personalizes your game. It uses local storage to save your name, even when you refresh your browser/page. It will ask for your name if there is no saved name. To change your name, type it in the toolbar where your name is shown.

## Toolbar

The toolbar contains statistics and game controls.

### Restart game

### Narrator
Due to issues, narrator has been removed. The diagram will be updated when there is a toolbar update.

### Toggle night mode (Dark Theme)

Whenever you type a wrong character, this increases, which affects your score. If you get no characters wrong, you will get a 100%.
Backspacing is supported, but will not increase your score.

### Parts
- **First box:** This contains the verse (e.g. "For God so loved the world...") and automatically scrolls (Not supported in Safari)
- **Second box:** This contains the reference (e.g. "John 3:16-17") and is right-aligned. After typing this part, you're done!

> To challenge yourself, you can time yourself. A timer was originally going to be in the game, but it didn't happen due to complications.

## I'm done, now what?

When you're done, you'll see the page above. On the left, you'll see your score. The ring will show your score and will show as red if your score is below 50%. On the right, you'll see an overview on the verse you typed. If you want a larger image of the image with the verse, hover over it, and you will not see the caption (source). You can play again to compare your score.
